# Emergency-App

The usage of this Web platform is to synchronize goverment's servises for the protection of civilians.The
civilians can call a number and report an incident (car accident,fire at a building,robbery etc).Then the person 
who received the call will use this platform to inform and organize different servises that are needed for an 
incident.He can inform a specific amount of persons of different servises and inform them of the situation.The officers will
get inform by their end of the platform and act accordingly.
He can revaluate the incident by appling more units to the situation or inform for a new information
that the people that are headed there must know.The platform is archiving all the incidents and how they were handled 
with their information and can show statistics based on different filters.The catalogs can be reviewed by the 
authorized persons.
Each person that is connected to the platform has his own account where his/hers information can be shown or changed.
